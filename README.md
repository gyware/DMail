A simple way to send email without an SMTP server.

## For Users
If you are just a regular windows user who wants to use DMail, it is recommended you download or run the [DMail HTA GUI](/HTA/GUI/DMail-GUI.hta). You can run other GUI's, but the HTA GUI is the most complete.

## For Advanced Users
For advanced users, the CLI is recommended (VB.NET or VBScript are the most complete right now).

## For Developers
For developers, we recommend the DMail functions as they can be integrated directly into your app with small snippet of code. Navigate to the directory of your desired language and download the function file (it will be named DMail-function with the file extension of the language it is written in).

## Features
* Send email without an SMTP server
* Uses **no** 3rd party APIs
* Optionally specify a custom SMTP server to use
* Written in 4 languages and counting

## Setup
### For regular and advanced users
Navigate to the directory for the programming language you want DMail in, then simply download the GUI or CLI, extract if necessary and run.

### For developers
Navigate to the directory for the programming language you want DMail in, then simply download the function file, add it somewhere in your code and call it whenever you want to use it.

*Easy to use, easy to understand.*
